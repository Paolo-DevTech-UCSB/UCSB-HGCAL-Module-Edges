# UCSB-HGCAL-Module-Edges

A geometrical tool for the placement and tiling mechanics of the HGCAL Modules and Cassette

By Paolo Jordano, Sussanne Kyre

Welcome To UCSB HGCAL Module Edges, 

This Code Serves Two Purposes:
    Firstly, It is the home of python files which contain a new tolerance system, as imagined by Sussanne Kyre, Joe Incandela, and Paolo Jordano. 
        These Files Can Be Found Here: UCSB-HGCAL-Module-Edges/Grading_Controllers/Grading_Code/..

    Secondly, It contains a number of 'controller' python files, which are plotters and data processors that make use of
    the tolerance python files.
        These Files Can Be Found Here: UCSB-HGCAL-Module-Edges/Grading_Controllers/..


-If you'd like to see the new tolerance system, Inspect the files offsets_HB.py and offsets_SR.py

-If you'd like to see data on yeilds, copy the relevant assembly data into input.txt and run one of the 'On_Data' Controllers.
